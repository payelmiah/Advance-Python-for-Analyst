# Advance Python for Analyst 📊
**Scientific Python Stack & Data Engineering Portfolio**

This repository documents my technical journey and mastery of the Python ecosystem for Data Science and Analytics. Based in Germany, I leverage my background in software development to build efficient, scalable data solutions.

## 🚀 Advanced Roadmap
I am systematically building a portfolio that covers the end-to-end data lifecycle:

### 🔹 Level 1: Core Analytics (Uploaded)
* **NumPy**: Vectorized mathematics and numerical processing.
* **Pandas**: Advanced data wrangling, cleaning, and exploratory analysis (EDA).
* **Matplotlib**: Statistical data visualization and reporting.
* **SciPy**: Scientific computing, optimization, and statistical testing.

### 🔹 Level 2: Statistical Modeling & ML (Next)
* **Seaborn**: High-level statistical visualizations.
* **Scikit-Learn**: Implementation of Regression, Classification, and Clustering models.
* **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw data into model-ready inputs.

### 🔹 Level 3: Data Engineering & Automation (Planned)
* **SQL Integration**: Building pipelines between Python and relational databases.
* **API & Web Scraping**: Automated data collection using BeautifulSoup and REST APIs.
* **Dashboarding**: Streamlining insights using automated reporting tools.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus
- **Efficiency**: Writing optimized code for large-scale data processing.
- **Precision**: Applying rigorous statistical methods via SciPy to validate findings.
- **Storytelling**: Converting complex datasets into clear, actionable business insights.
